Things to improve:
Docs 
Be more elaborate with the usage of custom component in docs
Hide the abstracted component props in the view code of the custom component

Maybe split the component into two, one that is more specific for components and one for basic Link
When passing a custom component the children that is wrapped in the Link is not rendered
